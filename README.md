# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions 🎄

Welcome to my repository containing solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges!  
Advent of Code is an annual event featuring programming puzzles that run from December 1st to 25th. Each day brings a new puzzle to solve, and it's a great way to practice problem-solving and coding skills.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized by year and day for easy navigation. Each year's folder contains subfolders for each day's puzzle.  
Here’s the general structure:

```bash
├── 2023/
│ ├── Day01/
│ │ └── solution.py # Solution script for Day 1
│ ├── Day02/
│ │ └── solution.py  # Solution script for Day 2
│ └── ...
├── 2024/
│ ├── Day01/
│ │ └── solution.py
│ ├── Day02/
│ │ └── solution.py
│ └── ...
└── ...
```

### Example:
- **`2024/Day01/solution.py`**: Python script containing the solution for Day 1 of the 2021 event.

---

## 📜 Years Covered

- [2024](./2024) *(work in progress)*
- [2023](./2023)

---

## 🚀 Running Solutions

Each solution is implemented as a standalone script. To run a solution:

1. Navigate to the respective directory, e.g., `2024/Day01/`.
2. Run the script using the proper language runtime (e.g., `python solution.py`).

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Primary Language**: Python 3 (some solutions might use more optimized language like C++)
- **Libraries**: Solutions may use common libraries like `collections` or `itertools` when needed.
